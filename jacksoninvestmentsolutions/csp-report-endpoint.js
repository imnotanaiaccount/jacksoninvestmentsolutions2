// This is a placeholder for a CSP violation reporting endpoint
// In a production environment, you would want to:
// 1. Set up a server-side endpoint to receive these reports
// 2. Log them for analysis
// 3. Review and adjust your CSP based on the reports

// Example of how to set up the reporting endpoint in your CSP header:
// Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self'; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint

// The actual implementation would depend on your backend technology
// (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
